These galaxies span a wide range of sizes, from dwarf galaxies containing as few as 100 million stars to giant galaxies with more than a trillion stars. Ellipticals, which account for about one-third of all galaxies, vary from nearly circular to very elongated. They possess comparatively little gas and dust, contain older stars and are not actively forming stars anymore. The largest and rarest of these, called giant ellipticals, are about 300,000 light-years across. Astronomers theorize that these are formed by the mergers of smaller galaxies. Much more common are dwarf ellipticals, which are only a few thousand light-years wide. Spiral galaxies appear as flat, blue-white disks of stars, gas and dust with yellowish bulges in their centers. These galaxies are divided into two groups: normal spirals and barred spirals. In barred spirals, the bar of stars runs through the central bulge. The arms of barred spirals usually start at the end of the bar instead of from the bulge. Spirals are actively forming stars and comprise a large fraction of all the galaxies in the local universe. Irregular galaxies, which have very little dust, are neither disk-like nor elliptical. Astronomers often see irregular galaxies as they peer deeply into the universe, which is equivalent to looking back in time. These galaxies are abundant in the early universe, before spirals and ellipticals developed. Aside from these three classic categories, astronomers have also identified many unusually shaped galaxies that seem to be in a transitory phase of galactic development. These include those in the process of colliding or interacting, and those with active nuclei ejecting jets of gas.

She was studying how galaxies spin when she realized the vast spiral Andromeda Galaxy seemed to be rotating strangely. In an apparent violation of Newton and Kepler’s Laws, the material at the galaxy’s edges was moving just as fast as the material near the center, even though most of the mass she could see was concentrated at the center. Some extra non-visible mass, dubbed dark matter, appeared to be holding the galaxy together. She soon discovered that a huge halo of dark matter was present in galaxy after galaxy that she examined. Dense packed stars extend from the inner hub of the galaxy Nearly half a century later, scientists still don’t know what dark matter is. They do know, however, that dark matter comprises some 84 percent of the universe’s material. Its invisible and ubiquitous presence affects how stars move within galaxies, how galaxies tug on each other and how matter clumped together in the early universe. Some of the best evidence for the existence of dark matter comes from galaxy cluster 1E 0657-556, also known as the Bullet Cluster. This cluster was formed after the collision of two large clusters of galaxies, the most energetic event known in the universe since the big bang. Because the major components of the cluster pair — stars, gas and the apparent dark matter — behave differently during collision, scientists were able to study them separately. The galaxies’ stars, which the Hubble and Magellan telescopes observed in visible light, were mostly unaffected by the collision, and passed right through. The hot gas from the two colliding clusters, seen in X-ray wavelengths by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, contains most of the cluster pair’s normal matter. Because the gases interact electromagnetically, the gases of both clusters slowed down much more than the stars. The third element in this collision, the dark matter, was detected indirectly by the gravitational lensing of background objects. The dark matter by definition does not interact electromagnetically (i.e., with light) – it’s dark! So during the collision, the dark matter clumps from the two clusters slide quietly past one another, just like the stars, leaving the hot gas (most of the normal matter) behind. The gravitational lensing stayed with the dark matter and not the gas. If hot gas was the most massive component in the clusters, such an effect would not be seen. Instead, the observations appear to be the first direct proof of dark matter.

While we don't know for certain how galaxies formed and took the many shapes that we presently see, we have some ideas about their origins and evolution. Using supercomputers, scientists can look back in time and simulate how a galaxy may have formed in the early universe and grown into what we see today. Astronomer Edwin Hubble’s observations led to the idea that the universe is expanding. Scientists estimate the age of the universe at 13.8 billion years based on the rate of expansion. Because the deeper you look into space, the further you see back in time, we can conclude that galaxies several billions of light-years away formed fairly soon after the big bang. While most galaxies formed early, data indicates that some galaxies have formed within the past few billion years — relatively recently in cosmic terms. The early universe was filled mainly with hydrogen and helium, with some areas slightly denser than others. These dense areas slightly slowed the universe’s expansion, allowing the hydrogen and helium to accumulate into small clouds swirling through space. Gravity caused the gas in these clouds to collapse and form the first generation of stars. These first stars rapidly burned out. Gravity continued to collapse the clouds. As other clouds came close to each other, gravity sent them careening into one another and knitted the clouds into larger, spinning packs. As the clouds further collapsed, they became rotating disks, which amassed more gas and dust. New stars formed, creating extensive spiral arms filled with colonies of stars. Sprinkled along the periphery were globular clusters, along with a halo of gas, dust and dark matter. While Hubble is unable to see the very first galaxies, it can track the development of galaxies over much of cosmic time. The series of Hubble Deep Field images and other deep surveys have uncovered galaxies at many different distances out in the universe, and therefore at many different times in their development. Farther galaxies, seen earlier in time, have less developed structure. Nearer galaxies, seen later in time, grow to resemble the familiar galaxy shapes we see in the local universe.

The Sun has six regions: the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone in the interior; the visible surface, called the photosphere; the chromosphere; and the outermost region, the corona.\n          At the core, the temperature is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius), which is sufficient to sustain thermonuclear fusion. This is a process in which atoms combine to form larger atoms and in the process release staggering amounts of energy. Specifically, in the Sun’s core, hydrogen atoms fuse to make helium.\n          The energy produced in the core powers the Sun and produces all the heat and light the Sun emits. Energy from the core is carried outward by radiation, which bounces around the radiative zone, taking about 170,000 years to get from the core to the top of the convective zone. The temperature drops below 3.5 million degrees Fahrenheit (2 million degrees Celsius) in the convective zone, where large bubbles of hot plasma (a soup of ionized atoms) move upwards. The surface of the Sun—the part we can see—is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius).

The bright streaks are called \"crater rays.\" They are formed when an asteroid or comet strikes the surface. The tremendous amount of energy that is released in such an impact digs a big hole in the ground, and also crushes a huge amount of rock under the point of impact. Some of this crushed material is thrown far from the crater and then falls to the surface, forming the rays. Fine particles of crushed rock are more reflective than large pieces, so the rays look brighter. The space environment—dust impacts and solar-wind particles—causes the rays to darken with time.\n          Temperatures on the surface of Mercury are extreme, both hot and cold.

The landscape is dusty, and surface temperatures reach a scalding 880 degrees Fahrenheit (471 degrees Celsius).\n        t is thought that Venus was completely resurfaced by volcanic activity 300 to 500 million years ago. Venus has two large highland areas: Ishtar Terra, about the size of Australia, in the north polar region; and Aphrodite Terra, about the size of South America, straddling the equator and extending for almost 6,000 miles (10,000 kilometers).\n        Venus is covered in craters, but none are smaller than 0.9 to 1.2 miles (1.5 to 2 kilometers) across. Small meteoroids burn up in the dense atmosphere, so only large meteoroids reach the surface and create impact craters.\n        Almost all the surface features of Venus are named for noteworthy Earth women — both mythological and real. A volcanic crater is named for Sacajawea, the Native American woman who guided Lewis and Clark's exploration. A deep canyon is named for Diana, Roman goddess of the hunt. "},{heading:"Atmosphere",content:"Venus' atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid droplets.

Atmospheric lightning bursts light up these quick-moving clouds. Speeds within the clouds decrease with cloud height, and at the surface are estimated to be just a few miles per hour.\n        On the ground, it would look like a very hazy, overcast day on Earth.

To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a leap year.\n        Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun and the southern hemisphere is tilted away.

There the temperature is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit (5,400 degrees Celsius). Surrounding the inner core is the outer core.

This hot, viscous mixture of molten rock is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick and has the consistency of caramel. The outermost layer, Earth's crust, goes about 19 miles (30 kilometers) deep on average on land.

Almost all of Earth's volcanoes are hidden under these oceans. Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano is taller from base to summit than Mount Everest, but most of it is underwater.

They are typically trapped by Earth's gravity for a a few months or years before returning to an orbit around the Sun. Some asteroids will be in a long “dance” with Earth as both orbit the Sun.\n        Some moons are bits of rock that were captured by a planet's gravity, but our Moon is likely the result of a collision billions of years ago. When Earth was a young planet, a large chunk of rock smashed into it, displacing a portion of Earth's interior. The resulting chunks clumped together and formed our Moon. With a radius of 1,080 miles (1,738 kilometers), the Moon is the fifth largest moon in our solar system (after Ganymede, Titan, Callisto and Io).\n        The Moon is farther away from Earth than most people realize.

Its volcanoes, impact craters, crustal movement, and atmospheric conditions such as dust storms have altered the landscape of Mars over many years, creating some of the solar system's most interesting topographical features.\n        A large canyon system called Valles Marineris is long enough to stretch from California to New York—more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers).

If Earth were the size of a nickel, Neptune would be about as big as a baseball.\n        From an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers), Neptune is 30 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 4 hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune."},{heading:"Orbit and Rotation",content:"One day on Neptune takes about 16 hours (the time it takes for Neptune to rotate or spin once). And Neptune makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Neptunian time) in about 165 Earth years (60,190 Earth days).\n        Sometimes Neptune is even farther from the Sun than dwarf planet Pluto. Pluto's highly eccentric, oval-shaped orbit brings it inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period every 248 Earth years. This switch, in which Pluto is closer to the Sun than Neptune, happened most recently from 1979 to 1999. Pluto can never crash into Neptune, though, because for every three laps Neptune takes around the Sun, Pluto makes two. This repeating pattern prevents close approaches of the two bodies.\n        Neptune’s axis of rotation is tilted 28 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, which is similar to the axial tilts of Mars and Earth. This means that Neptune experiences seasons just like we do on Earth; however, since its year is so long, each of the four seasons lasts for over 40 years."},{heading:"Formation",content:"Neptune took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Uranus, Neptune likely formed closer to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago. "},{heading:"Sturcture",content:"Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus). Most (80 percent or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of \"icy\" materials—water, methane and ammonia—above a small, rocky core. Of the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.\n        Scientists think there might be an ocean of super hot water under Neptune's cold clouds. It does not boil away because incredibly high pressure keeps it locked inside. "},{heading:"Surface",content:"Neptune does not have a solid surface. Its atmosphere (made up mostly of hydrogen, helium and methane) extends to great depths, gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier, solid core with about the same mass as Earth."},{heading:"Atmosphere",content:"Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of methane. Neptune's neighbor Uranus is a blue-green color due to such atmospheric methane, but Neptune is a more vivid, brighter blue, so there must be an unknown component that causes the more intense color.\n        Neptune is our solar system's windiest world. Despite its great distance and low energy input from the Sun, Neptune's winds can be three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than Earth's. These winds whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per hour). Even Earth's most powerful winds hit only about 250 miles per hour (400 kilometers per hour)        \n        In 1989 a large, oval-shaped storm in Neptune's southern hemisphere dubbed the \"Great Dark Spot\" was large enough to contain the entire Earth.

Neptune's largest moon Triton was discovered on October 10, 1846, by William Lassell, just 17 days after Johann Gottfried Galle discovered the planet. Since Neptune was named for the Roman god of the sea, its moons are named for various lesser sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.\n        Triton is the only large moon in the solar system that circles its planet in a direction opposite to the planet's rotation (a retrograde orbit), which suggests that it may once have been an independent object that Neptune captured. Triton is extremely cold, with surface temperatures around minus 391 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 235 degrees Celsius). And yet, despite this deep freeze at Triton, Voyager 2 discovered geysers spewing icy material upward more than 5 miles (8 kilometers). Triton's thin atmosphere, also discovered by Voyager, has been detected from Earth several times since, and is growing warmer, but scientists do not yet know why."},{heading:"Rings",content:"Neptune at least five main rings and four prominient ring arcs that we know of so far. Starting near the planet and moving outward, the main rings are named Galle, Leverrier, Lassell, Arago and Adams. The rings are thought to be relatively young and short-lived.\n        Neptune's ring system also has peculiar clumps of dust called arcs. Four prominent arcs named Liberté (Liberty), Egalité (Equality), Fraternité (Fraternity) and Courage are in the outermost ring, Adams. The arcs are strange because the laws of motion would predict that they would spread out evenly rather than stay clumped together. Scientists now think the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring, stabilizes these arcs.

Some people call the far side &mdash; the hemisphere we never see from Earth &mdash; the "dark side," but that\'s misleading. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts are in sunlight or darkness at different times. The changing illumination is why, from our perspective, the Moon goes through phases. During a "full moon," the hemisphere of the Moon we can see from Earth is fully illuminated by the sun. And a "new moon" occurs when the far side of the Moon has full sunlight, and the side facing us is having its night.\n        The Moon makes a complete orbit around Earth in 27 Earth days and rotates or spins at that same rate, or in that same amount of time.

Tycho Crater is more than 52 miles (85 kilometers) wide.\n\n        Over billions of years, these impacts have ground up the surface of the Moon into fragments ranging from huge boulders to powder. Nearly the entire Moon is covered by a rubble pile of charcoal-gray, powdery dust and rocky debris called the lunar regolith. Beneath is a region of fractured bedrock referred to as the megaregolith.\n        \n        The light areas of the Moon are known as the highlands. The dark features, called maria (Latin for seas), are impact basins that were filled with lava between 4.2 and 1.2 billion years ago. These light and dark areas represent rocks of different composition and ages, which provide evidence for how the early crust may have crystallized from a lunar magma ocean. The craters themselves, which have been preserved for billions of years, provide an impact history for the moon and other bodies in the inner solar system.\n        \n        If you looked in the right places on the Moon, you would find pieces of equipment, American flags, and even a camera left behind by astronauts.

The surface is protected by a layer, a few centimeters of dry soil that can only be breached by large micrometeoroids.
