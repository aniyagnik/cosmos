        A celestial object is a naturally happening phenomenon that occurs in
        the observable universe. In astronomy, the word object and body are
        often used interchangeably. On the other hand, a celestial body is a
        solo, strongly bound, adjoining entity, while the celestial object is a
        complex, less cohesively bound structure, which may consist of multiple
        bodies or even other objects with substructures. Celestial bodies or
        heavenly groups are objects in space such as the sun, planets, moon, and
        stars. <br>
        They form a part of the massive universe we live in and are typically
        very far from us. The magnificent night sky is dotted with such objects
        and when we see them using a telescope,they expose fascinating worlds of
        their own. Because they are so far away, we cannot see all of them with
        the naked eye and we depend upon telescopes to study them. The word
        celestial body is as wide as the entire universe, for both known and
        unknown. By definition, a celestial body is any natural object outside
        of the Earth’s atmosphere. Simple examples are the Moon, Sun, and the
        other planets of our solar system. But those are very partial examples.
        The Kuiper belt holds many celestial bodies. Any asteroid in space is a
        celestial body.

     <h3>STAR</h3>
     <p>
        A star is a form of a celestial object made up of a
        shining spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearby
        star to Earth is the Sun. Several other stars are visible to the naked
        eye from Earth during the night time, looking at a multitude
        of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their enormous distance from
        Earth. Historically, the most noticeable stars were grouped
        into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper
        tags. Astronomers have drawn together star catalogues that identify the
        known stars and deliver standardized stellar designations. However, it
        is estimated that there are over 300 sextillions (3×10^23 ) stars in
        the Universe, including all-stars outside our galaxy (the Milky Way),
        are invisible to the naked eye from Earth.
        <br>
        A star's life stat with the gravitational collapse of a
        gaseous nebula of material composed mostly of hydrogen, along with
        helium and small amounts of heavier elements. When the lunar core is
        sufficiently thick, hydrogen becomes gradually converted into helium
        through nuclear fusion, liberating energy in the process. The rest of
        the interior of the startransfers energy away from the core through a
        mixture of the radiative and convective heat transfer process. The
        interior pressure prevents it from collapsing further under its own
        gravity. A star with mass bigger than 0.4 times the Sun'smasswill expand
        to become a red hulk when the hydrogen fuel in its core is exhausted.

     <h3>PLANET</h3>
     <p>
       A planet is abodythat revolves around a star that is enormousenough to
        be spherical by its own magnitude, is not huge enough to
        cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring
        region of planetesimals.
        <br>
        The word planet is an ancient word which ties to history, astrology,
        science, mythology, and religion. Five planets in the Solar System are
        seen with our naked eye. These were observed by many early cultures as
        celestial, or as emissaries of idols. As logical knowledge advanced,
        human awareness of the planets changed, incorporating severaldissimilar
        objects.in our solar system, we have eight planets they are Mercury,
        Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

        Planets are mostly divided into two main types: big low-density giant
        planets, and smaller stony terrestrials. There are eight planets in the
        Solar System. In order of rising distance from the Sun, they
        are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four giant
        planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Six of the planets are
        circled by one or more natural satellites.
        <br>
        Numerous thousands of planets around other stars ("extrasolar planets"
        or "exoplanets") have been shown in the Milky Way. As of 5 Feb 2019,
        3,956 known extrasolar planets in 2,973 planetary systems (plus
        654 multiple planetary systems), going in size from just above the size
        of the Moon to gas goliaths about twice as large as Jupiter have been
        discovered, out of which more than 100 planets are of the same size as
        Earth, nine of which are at the same comparative distance from their
        star as Earth from the Sun, i.e. in the circumstellar habitable area.
     </p>
      <br>
     <h3>Satellites</h3>
     <p>
       It is a natural celestial object with arecognized orbit around a planet
        of the Solar System, some as small as a kilometre across. In the Solar
        System, there are six terrestrial satellite systems covering 185 known
        natural satellites. Four IAU-Mentioned dwarf planets are also known to
        have natural satellites: Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris. As of
        September 2018, there are 334 other small planets known to have moons.
        <br>
        The Earth-Moon structure is unique in that the ratio of the mass of the
        Moon to the frame of Earth is much greater than that of any other
        natural-satellite–planet proportion in the Solar System (although there
        are minor-planet systems with even greater ratios, notably
        the Pluto–Charon system).

     <h3>COMETS</h3>
     <p>
       A comet is an icy object which is present in Solar System object that,
      when travelling close to the Sun, it warms and start to emit gases, a
      practice known as outgassing. This creates a visible atmosphere or coma,
      and sometimes also a tail. These occurrences are due to the effects
      of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the core of the
      comet. Comet core range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometres
      across and are made up of loose collections of ice, dust, and small
      rocky particles. The coma can be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter,
      while the tail may give one astronomical unit. If satisfactorily bright,
      a comet may be seen from the Earth without the help of a telescope and
      may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) through the sky. Comets have been
      seen and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.
      <br>
      Comets are distinguished from asteroid-ds by the existence of an
      extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere nearby their central core.
      This atmosphere has parts named as the coma which is surrounded by its
      nuclei (the central part immediately surrounding the core) and the tail
      (a usually linear section consisting of dust or gas is blown emitting
      out from the coma by the Sun's RAYS pressure or out streaming solar air
      plasma). However, dead comets that have passed close to the Sun several
      times and have lost nearly all of their volatile ices and dust and may
      come to resemble minor asteroids. Asteroids are assumed to have a
      different origin than comets, having formed around Jupiter orbit rather
      than in the outer Solar System. The discovery of main-belt comets and
      lively centaur minor planets has a fuzzy distinction between asteroids
      and comets. In the first period of the 21st century, there was the
      discovery of some minor bodies with long-period comet orbits, but
      features of inner solar system asteroids were called Manx comets.

     <h3>ASTEROIDS</h3>
     <p>
       Asteroids are small planets, especially of the inside Solar System. Big
        asteroids are also called planetoids. These expressions have
        historically been applied to any astronomical body orbiting the Sun that
        did not look like a planet-like disc and was not seen to have
        characteristics of a lively comet such as a tail. As small planets in
        the outer Solar System were discovered theywere naturally found to
        have volatile-rich tops likecomets. As a result, they were frequently
        famed from objects found in the main asteroid belt., the word "asteroid"
        refers to the small planets of the inner Solar System.

        <br>
        There are zillions of asteroids, many assumed to be the crushed
        leftovers of planetesimals, bodies within the young Sun's solar
        nebula that never grew big enough to become planets. The massive
        majority of known asteroids orbit within the key asteroid belt located
        between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter oris co-orbital with Jupiter
        (the Jupiter Trojans). However, several other orbital families exist
        with significant populations, including the near-Earth objects. Single
        asteroids are categorized by their typical spectra, with the majority
        falling into three key groups: C-type, M-type, and S-type. These were
        termed after and are usually identified with carbon-rich, metallic,
        and silicate (stony) configurations, respectively. The sizes of
        asteroids vary greatly; the largest, Ceres, is almost 1,000 km (625 mi)
        across.
        <br>
        Asteroids are separated from comets and meteoroids. In the case of
        comets, the difference is one of composition: while asteroids are mainly
        made of mineral and rock, comets are mainly composed of dust and ice.
        Furthermore, asteroids are formed closer to the sun, preventing the
        progress of cometary ice. The difference between asteroids and
        meteoroids is mainly of size: meteoroids have a radius of one meter or
        less, whereas asteroids have a radius greater than one meter. Finally,
        meteoroids can be made of either cometary or asteroidalmaterials.
     </p>
       <br>
     <h3>Meteor and Meteorites</h3>
     <p>
       A meteor, also known as a shooting star, the path of meteor is visible
      and glowing meteoroids glowing meteoroid, comet or asteroid through
      Earth's atmosphere, after being heated to burning by collisions with air
      molecules in the upper atmosphere, making a streak of light via its
      quick motion and sometimes also by flaking glowing material in it.
      Although a meteor may seem like few thousand feet from the Earth meteors
      naturally occur in the mesosphere at altitudes from 76 to 100 km
      (250,000 to 330,000 ft). The root word meteor comes from
      the Greek meteōros, that says “tall in the air".
      <br>
      Billions of meteors enter Earth's atmosphere daily. Most meteoroids that
      cause meteors are about the size of a particle of sand, i.e. they are
      usually millimeter-sized or even smaller. Meteoroid sizes can be
      measured from their mass and density which, in turn, can be expected
      from the observed meteor trajectory in the higher atmosphereMeteors
      showers is a natural phenomenon and it can occur in showers, which
      begins when Earth travellthrough a tributary of debris left by a comet,
      or as "random" or meteors, not associated with a specific stream
      of space debris. Severalspecific meteors have been seen, largely by
      members of the public and other largely by accident, but with enough
      information that orbits of the meteoroids producing the meteors have
      been measured. The atmospheric speeds of meteors result from the
      movement of Earth around the Sun at about 30 km/s (68,000 mph), the
      orbital speeds of meteoroids, and the gravity well of Earth.

     <h3>GALAXY</h3>
     <p>
      A galaxy is a gravitational system of stars, interstellar gas, stellar
      fragments,  dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is originated from
      the Greek word galaxies (γαλαξίας), literally meaning "milky", a
      reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies are in size from small with just a
      few hundred million (10^8 ) stars to colossi with one
      hundred trillion (10^14 ) stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.
      <br>
      Galaxies are characterized according to their visual morphology
      as oval, spiral, or irregular. Many galaxies are believed to
      have supermassive black holes at their cores. The Milky Way's central
      black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a weight of four million times
      greater than the Sun. Since April 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and
      bestreserved observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32
      billion light-years from Earth and observed as it existed just 400
      million years after the Big Bang.
      <br>
      The space between galaxies is filled with an unsubstantiated gas
      (the intergalactic medium) having an average mass of less than
      one atom per cubic meter. Mostgalaxies are gravitationally systematized
      into groups, clusters, and superclusters. The Milky Way is part of
      the Local Group, which is ruled by it and the Andromeda Galaxy and is
      part of the Virgo Supercluster. At the biggest scale, these associations
      are mostly arranged into sheets and filaments surrounded by
      immense spaces. The biggest structure of galaxies yet to recognize as a
      cluster of superclusters that has been termed Laniakea, which holds the
      Virgo supercluster.
